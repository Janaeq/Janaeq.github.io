Writing this final blog is definitely bittersweet, however I am so happy to finally say that I have made it to the finishline!
Flatiron has taught me so much about myself and how much I am able to push myself to learn new things. 

Before attending Flatiron, I barely knew how to write HTML and CSS. I didn't even know how to use chrome dev tools! Now, I am able to create fullstack responsive web applications. I would have never thought that someone like me could learn how to code.

Going through this program was most definitely a challenge. Being a healthcare worker in the midst of a pandemic all while trying to keep up with labs and create projects on time was almost impossible. There were times where I felt like I just simply had no time and I felt so behind, but the encourgement and support from my cohort lead never failed to motivate me to create and learn and I am immensely thankful for that.

As I move on to my job search, I look forward to continue learning and collaborating with people who were once in my shoes and are now writing code that changes the digital world we live in. In the next few months with practice and dedication, I see myself getting more confident in my abilities to create better programs and hopefully in the next few years I can be a mentor to someone who is just starting to code. It will all be thanks to my journey here at Flatiron!
