For my final Flatiron project, I decided to create a program where users can share photos of their favorite home dishes with the ingredients they use and directions on how to prepare the dish. 

This project was inspiried by Instagram and so there are a lot of features that I plan on implementing in the future to make it more similar to Instagram. 

Using react and redux was a challenge for me because it was so new, but once I got all the boilerplate and terminology down (along with countless hours of google searches), I found redux to be really convenient in holding my application's state in one place. 

I also learned that having state opens up a whole new world of capabilities for your application. Rather than using countless event listeners as in Vanilla JavaScript, state cleans up your code immensely so that you can simply use booleans and such to make your application more responsive. I also noticed that using state allowed my application to run a lot faster as opposed to my previous project where I strictly used event listeners. 

Even with the verbose code in my front end repo, my runs without lag and I think that's what amazes me about using react and redux. In the future I plan on cleaning up my code, but for now I am very happy with how much of a difference these frameworks have made for my project.
